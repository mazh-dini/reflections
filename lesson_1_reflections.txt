diff -u oldFile newFile // Compare the difference between the files + corresponds to a new line and - corresponds to a removed line

pwd # print working directory
ls # list the files in this directory

How did viweing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed what was changed side by side with both new and old code, which made it easy to identify the mistake which in this case was a spelling mistake

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more effecient programmer in the long term

git log # shows all commits and their messages
git diff id1 id2 # shows differences between git versions similar to diff -u file1 file2
adding the paramater git log --stat shows what files have been changed

Make one commit per logical change

git clone url
